# Changes from v2.4.x

- Constructor from patch, internal field, and dictionary: If a value is provided in the BC dict,
  then apply operator== instead of operator= (change in OpenFOAM-6). Otherwise, call update the
  fixed values and then apply operator== instead of calling evaluate(). Evaluate() calls:
  ```
  void Foam::mixedFvPatchField<Type>::evaluate(const Pstream::commsTypes)
  {
      if (!this->updated())
      {
          this->updateCoeffs();
      }

      Field<Type>::operator=
      (
          valueFraction_*refValue_
        +
          (1.0 - valueFraction_)*
          (
              this->patchInternalField()
            + refGrad_/this->patch().deltaCoeffs()
          )
      );

      fvPatchField<Type>::evaluate();
  }
  ```
  However, this is a non-starter because the call to updateCoeffs() will fail prior to the first
  time step because phi has not been calculated. Instead, we call updateFixedValue()--the original
  part of timeVaryingMappedFixedValue--followed by operator== to set the value to the provided
  reference values from constant/boundaryData. _This may have been avoided in the past by always
  specifying the value keyword._

- Separate updateCoeffs into separate, self-explanatory `updateFixedValue()` and
  `updateInletOutlet()` functions.

- `valueFraction` is calculated as 1 - pos0(phi), where pos0 is 1 if >= 0 and 0 otherwise, instead
  of 1 - pos(phi) (OpenFOAM-6 change).

- `evaluate()` is now overridden to provide statistics about valueFraction.

- `operator=` is no longer overridden; this was a redefinition of the more general calculation in
  evaluate(), but without the "refGradient" term. In our case, refGradient is always set to zero 
  and the inherited operator= and operator== should be consistent. 


## Minor changes affecting usage

- Added `format` keyword (either "ascii" or "binary") to allow input points and sample files to
  be in uncompressed/compressed ascii/binary format.
- `AverageIOField` has been replaced in OpenFOAM-6 by `AverageField`, which is no longer derived 
  from the `regIOobject` class. The "FoamFile" header dictionary should therefore be omitted.
- Added optional keywords "dataDir", "points", and "sample" in OpenFOAM-6.
