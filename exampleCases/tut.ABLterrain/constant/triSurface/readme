# readme for ${caseDir}/constant/triSurface

The terrain .stl files should go in this directory. The `terrain.stl` file referenced to by the scripts is a dynamic link to the actual STL. 

To translate an STL file, use a call like the following:

surfaceTransformPoints -translate '(0 0 -1028)' file.stl file_shifted.stl
